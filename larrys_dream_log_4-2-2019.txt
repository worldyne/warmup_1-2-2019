I was in the woods, running away from a spooky ghost.
I found a golden apple at the end of the road.
The ghost screamed "MY APPLE, MY APPLE"
I spun around and frantically shouted, "It's yours, it's yours!"
The ghost angrily spat in my face a dollop of ectoplasm.
I shot up awake in my bed, sweat on my brow, shivers down my spine.

The End.
